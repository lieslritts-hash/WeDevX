The range of a Tesla Model Y on 1% battery can vary
based on several factors such as driving conditions,
speed, weather, and the vehicle's battery capacity.
According to Tesla's official website, the Long Range
Model Y has an estimated range of 326 miles. So, based
on these estimates, a Model Y should be able to drive
3.15 on 1% of its battery. I have 42% on battery life
on my Tesla Model Y. Write a program that will store
the values of myCurrentBatteryLifePercentage and
milesPer1Percent in the most suitable data types.
Then create a totalDistanceRange variable where the
value is the multiplication of myCurrentBatteryLifePercentage
and milesPer1Percent. End the program by printing out the value
of totalDistanceRange.

java
Copy code
_____ myCurrentBatteryLifePercentage = _______;
_____ milesPer1Percent = _______;
_____ totalDistanceRange = _______;

System.out.println(totalDistanceRange);

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        double myCurrentBatteryLifePercentage = 42;
        double milesPer1Percent = 3.15;
        double totalDistanceRange = myCurrentBatteryLifePercentage * milesPer1Percent;
        System.out.println(totalDistanceRange);
